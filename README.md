**My Todo-List App**


As a very forgetful person, I decided to create a to-do list using React.JS to remind me of all my responsibilities. The webapp allows you to add, edit, & delete your todos. Moreover, all of the todos are saved on local storage, which allows users to refresh the page
and see their to-do list! Here's a preview of the web app:

In the future, I will be adding a lot mroe functionality. So make sure to stay tuned for any updates!
